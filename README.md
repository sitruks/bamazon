# ùõÉAMAZON
bAMAZON is an Amazon-like storefront supported by a MySQL database. The app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. As an added bonus, it can track product sales across one's store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
